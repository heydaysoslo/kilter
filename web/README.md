### Stylelinting

We now use [ðŸ“š`stylelint-prettier/recommended`](https://github.com/prettier/stylelint-config-prettier/blob/master/src/index.js) for our stylelinting. This is controlled in `package.json`. Also check out [ðŸ“šstylelint-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/stylelint-prettier).

#### Bring your own rules

[ðŸ“š Stylelint docs](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules)

```json
// In package.json
{
  "stylelint": {
    "rules": {
      "declaration-block-no-duplicate-properties": true,
      "block-no-empty": true,
      "declaration-empty-line-before": "never",
      "at-rule-empty-line-before": [
        "always",
        {
          "except": [
            "after-same-name",
            "blockless-after-same-name-blockless",
            "blockless-after-blockless",
            "first-nested"

### netlify.toml

Netlify does not like monorepos that much. Therefore we'll need a little work around.
We need two toml files one in the root which is the one netlify will use, and on in the
`/web` root which `gatsby-plugin-netlify-functions` will use. You only need the output
path for the one in `/web`.

Enviroment variables for production are kept in the .toml file. Make sure you update both places when you change a value.
